# MongoDB Aggregation: Handling Nulls in Most Frequent Value Query

This repository demonstrates a common issue in MongoDB aggregation pipelines when dealing with fields containing null or undefined values, and provides a solution.

## Bug
The provided aggregation pipeline attempts to find the most frequent value in a specified field. However, if the field contains null or undefined values, the pipeline may produce incorrect results or errors.

## Solution
The solution involves adding a stage to filter out null or undefined values before performing the grouping and sorting operations. This ensures that only valid values are considered when determining the most frequent value.  The $match stage in the improved pipeline handles this effectively.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace 'myCollection' and 'fieldName' with your actual collection and field names.
3. Run the modified aggregation pipeline in your MongoDB shell or application.
